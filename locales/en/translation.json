I love learning new technologies and be up to date about what's new in the world of development and cibersecurity.</p><p>One of the things I like the most about programming is that it allows me to find solutions for everything, that's why I'm a big fan of scripting. If I have to do anything, I'm sure it can be automated with a script.</p><p>I have a better time on the Frontend, which is the least I touch 😟.</p><p>One day I would like to become a master of JavaScript, but it changes every year so it's hard to follow 😂</p><p> Always ready to have fun with new challenges. But no challenge can be tougher than being the parent of a baby 👶.</p> ",
